Test-Driven Developmentis a software engineering method-ology with proposed application to ontology engineering [9].It requires sophisticated tools, but all existing ontology test-ing tools have shortcomings which limit their usefulness, andno formal analysis has been done of their algorithms.  In or-der to facilitate the development and advancement of suchtools, we present a formal model of ontology testing and newtesting algorithms.  We rigorously prove correctness of these algorithms.
