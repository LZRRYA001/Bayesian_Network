This paper focuses on the use of trend lines as a feature extractiontechnique on financial time series data. Trend lines are extractedusing segmentation algorithms, several algorithms will be evaluatedand compared. Machine learning models will be trained using trendlines and compared to a baseline, to assess the effectiveness of usingtrend lines for prediction. It was found that using trend lines as afeature extraction technique and machine learning using a LongShorter Term Memory or Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networkfor prediction does not compare to using point data as a featureand the same machine learning models for predictio
