Module extraction is an important reasoning task, aiding in the design, reuse and maintenance of ontologies.  Reasoning services such as subsumption testing and MinA extraction have been shown to benefit from module extraction methods.  Though various syntactic traversal-based module extraction algorithms exist for extracting modules, many only consider the subsumee of a subsumption statement as a selection criterion for reducing the axioms in the module.In this dissertation we extend the bottom-up reachability-based module extraction heuristic for the inexpressive Description Logic EL, by introducing a top-down version of the heuristic which utilises the subsumer of a subsumption statement as a selection criterion to minimize the number of axioms in a module.  Then a combined bidirectional heuristic is introduced which uses both operands of a subsumption statement in order to extract very small modules. We then investigate the relationship between MinA extraction and bidirectional reachability-based module extraction.  We provide empirical evidence that bidirectional reachability-based module extraction for subsumption entailments in EL provides a significant reduction in the size of modules for almost no additional costs in the running time of the original algorithms.
