Propositional Typicality Logic (PTL) is a recently proposed formof logic. It extends Classical Propositional Logic by the addition ofTypicality with the typicality operator (•). The typicality operatoris based on and extends the work done in the KLM-Approach withthe defeasibility operator (|∼) first suggested by Kraus et al [9]. Theextension is that the typicality operator is an unary operator, whilethe defeasibility operator is a binary operator.There have been two forms of entailment for PTL suggested byBooth et al [2]: they are LM and PT Entailment. Both of these formsof entailment are extensions of the Rational Closure Construction and Algorithm first shown in Lehmann and Magidor [11] for De-feasibile Reasoning. Both forms of entailment focus on satisfying adifferent subset of properties.This paper is a proof of concept of an implementation of LM En-tailment, reducing the entailment problem in PTL to a series ofClassical Entailment checks which are effected by a SAT-Solver.The reduction is achieved by performing the algorithm put forwardfor LM-Entailment to make the LM Preference Relation, then con-verting this ranked model to be compatible with the SAT-Solver.This paper shows a successful proof of concept of an LM-Entailmentimplementation, having been successfully tested with sample knowl-edge bases. Possible future work could include producing sampleknowledge bases to test all the properties of entailment in PTL andto theoretically produce the Ranked Models that LM Entailmentproduces with these knowledge bases. Working on the efficiencyof the implementation is also a possibility, as this was not focusedon in this pape
