This paper investigates the impact of imposing a cost on morpho-logical complexity in the co-evolution of control policy (behaviour)and sensory configuration (morphology) for robot teams in different environments. Namely, we investigate (1) evolving lower morpho-logical complexity without sacrificing behavioural competence in agiven environment and (2) the relationship between selection pres-sure for morphological complexity and environmental difficulty.Two experiment sets use direct-encoded Neuro-evolution to evolveteam controller-morphology couplings in three environments ofincreasing difficulty. A single Task Performance objective is max-imised in the first set of experiments, while both Task Performanceand a Morphological Simplicity objective (that is, a cost of complex-ity) are maximised in the second set. Overall a cost of complexitywas found to be beneficial for Multi-Robot System design. Resultsindicate that, in a given environment, evolution with a cost oncomplexity produces teams which are morphologically simpler andas behaviourally competent as teams evolved without a complexityconstraint. Additionally, with a cost of complexity, evolution main-tained a constant selection pressure for morphological complexityacross all environments
