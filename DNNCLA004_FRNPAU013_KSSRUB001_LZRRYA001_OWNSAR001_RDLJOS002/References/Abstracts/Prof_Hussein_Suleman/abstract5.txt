The current medley of interoperability protocols is potentially problematic. Each protocol is designed by a different group, each provides a single service, and has its own syntax and vocabulary. Popular protocols such as RSS are designed with simple and easy to understand documentation, which is a key factor for the high adoption levels. But the majority of protocols are complex, making them relatively difficult for programmers to understand and implement.
This research proposes a possible new direction for high-level interoperability protocols design.
The High-level Interoperability Protocol - Common Framework (HIP-CF) is designed and evaluated as a proof of concept that if interoperability is made simpler, then it can increase adoption levels, making it easier for programmers to understand and implement protocols, therefore leading to more interoperable systems.
HIP-CF is not suggested as the alternative to current production protocols. Rather it is suggested that the design approach taken by HIP-CF can be applied to other protocols, and also that a suite of simpler protocols is a better solution than various simple individual protocols. Evaluation results show that current protocols can be substantially improved on. These improvements could and maybe should be the result of a deeper analysis of the goals of todayâ€™s protocols and also a collaboration amongst the different groups that design high-level interoperability protocols.
This research presents a new approach and suggests future experimental research options for the field of high-level interoperability protocol design.
