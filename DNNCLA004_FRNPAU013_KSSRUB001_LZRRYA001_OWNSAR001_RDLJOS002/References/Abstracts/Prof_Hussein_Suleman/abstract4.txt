The digital Bleek and Lloyd Collection is a rare collection that contains art-work, notebooks and dictionaries of the earliest habitants of Southern Africa. Previous attempts have been made to recognize the complex text in the note-books  using  machine  learning  techniques,  but  due  to  the  complexity  of  the manuscripts  the  recognition  accuracy  was  low.   In  this  research,  a  crowd-sourcing  based  method  is  proposed  to  transcribe  the  historical  handwritten manuscripts,  where  volunteers  transcribe  the  notebooks  online.   An  online crowdsourcing  transcription  tool  was  developed  and  deployed.   Experiments were  conducted  to  determine  the  quality  of  transcriptions  and  accuracy  of the volunteers compared with a gold standard.  The results show that volunteers  are  able  to  produce  reliable  transcriptions  of  high  quality.   The  inter-transcriber agreement is 80% for|Xam text and 95% for English text.  When the |Xam text transcriptions produced by the volunteers are compared with the gold standard,  the volunteers achieve an average accuracy of 69.69%.  Findings  show  that  there  exists  a  positive  linear  correlation  between  the  inter-transcriber agreement and the accuracy of transcriptions.  The user survey revealed that volunteers found the transcription process enjoyable, though it was difficult.  Results indicate that volunteer thinking can be used to crowdsource intellectually-intensive tasks in digital libraries like transcription of handwrit-ten manuscripts.  Volunteer thinking outperforms machine learning technique sat the task of transcribing notebooks from the Bleek and Lloyd Collection.
