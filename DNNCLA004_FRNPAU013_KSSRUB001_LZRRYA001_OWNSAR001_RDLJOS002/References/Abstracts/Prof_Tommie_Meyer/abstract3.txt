Description Logics (DLs) that support uncertainty are not as well studied as their crisp alternatives.  This limits their application in many real world domains, which often require reasoning about uncertain or contradictory information.  In this thesis we  present  the  Bayesian  Description  Logic BALC,  which  takes  existing  work  on Bayesian Description Logics and applies it to the classical Description Logic ALC. We define five reasoning problems for BALC; two versions of concept satisfiability (called total and partial respectively), knowledge base consistency, three subsumption problems (positive subsumption, p-subsumption, exact subsumption), instance  checking,  and  the  most  likely  context problem.   Consistency,  satisfiability, and instance checking have not previously been studied in the context of contextual Bayesian DLs and as such this is new work.  We then go on to provide algorithms that solve all of these reasoning problems, with the exception of the most likely context problem. We found that all reasoning problems in BALC are in the same complexity classas their classical variants, provided that the size of the Bayesian Network is included in the size of the knowledge base. That is, all reasoning problems mentioned above(excluding most likely context) are exponential in the size of the knowledge base and the size of the Bayesian Network.
